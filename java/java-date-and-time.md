# Java Date and Time

The [Calendar class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week.

You are given a date. You just need to write the method, **_getDay_**, which returns the day on that date. To simplify your task, we have provided a portion of the code in the editor.

For example, if you are given the date **_August 14th 2017_**, the method should return **_MONDAY_** as the day on that date.
